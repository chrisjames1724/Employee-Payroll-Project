In this project we were supposed to simulate an employee paroll tracker to view and manage employee payrool data which was given using a bit of starter code. We needed to modify the starter code using Javascript to create a responsive user interface with click functions initializing defined prompts. Throughout the project we learned to to collect data, store it, and use varying functions to find averages, random generate and alphabatize different emplpoyee date.
